# Quiz App (FE Capstone)

A small React + Vite quiz app that fetches questions from the Open Trivia Database API.

Features:
- Fetches categories and questions from OpenTDB
- Choose category, number of questions, and difficulty
- One question at a time, multiple choice
- Immediate feedback and final score summary
- Quiz history persisted to localStorage with simple stats
- Responsive UI (vanilla CSS; Tailwind can be added)

Getting started (Windows PowerShell):

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Open the shown local URL in your browser.

Notes:
- This scaffold uses the Open Trivia DB API; no API key required.
- To use Tailwind properly, install and configure Tailwind (instructions omitted here). For quick prototyping, you can also uncomment the Tailwind CDN in `index.html`.

Next steps I can help with:
- Add Tailwind configuration and install packages
- Improve styling and accessibility
- Deploy to Vercel or Netlify and add the deployment link
